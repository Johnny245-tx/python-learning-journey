Learning Python for data analysis and backend development

# Python Learning Journey - 6 Month Bootcamp

**Goal:** Transition from physics student to employable Python developer in 6 months

## About Me

Physics student (8th semester) learning programming to work in tech.  
Background in entrepreneurship (ran successful clothing business during pandemic).  
Combining analytical thinking from physics with practical coding skills.

**Current Status:** Month 1, Day 19/30

## Learning Path

## Learning Notes

This repository documents my journey from physics student to professional developer. Each project and exercise represents real learning, mistakes, and growth.

I'm using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) as learning assistants - not to generate code blindly, but to understand concepts, review my work, and learn best practices. This is the new way to learn programming in 2026.

**Last Updated:** January 16, 2026  
**Target Completion:** June 2026  
**Current Focus:** Python fundamentals and modular code design
